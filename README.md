# css_injector_import
Drupal module for import CSS Injector rules from production to pre-production environments.

As a developer I would like to have a functionality to import CSS Injector rules from production environment to pre-production environments by 1-click-action. Right now CSS Injector rules cannot be exported/imported using "BackUp & migrate" module or DB update from production. It can be imported only using copy-paste method, which can take some time. And this module created to solve issue with manual copy-paste work.
